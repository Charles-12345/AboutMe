## 🚀 Transforming Data into Impact

I design and build **digital MEL systems** that turn complex data into actionable insights for international development programmes. With 10+ years engineering data solutions for **USAID**, **CDC**, **BMGF**, and **GAVI** programmes, I've helped organizations track impact across **2+ million beneficiaries** in fragile and conflict-affected contexts.

### 💡 What I Do

- 🎯 **MEL Systems Engineering**: Design end-to-end monitoring frameworks that improve data accuracy from 85% to 98%
- 📊 **Business Intelligence**: Build automated Power BI dashboards with ETL pipelines that reduce processing time by 60%
- 🐍 **Data Automation**: Develop Python scripts for validation, cleaning, and analytics at scale
- 🗺️ **Geospatial Analysis**: Leverage QGIS and Python to identify coverage gaps and inform resource allocation
- 🏗️ **Capacity Building**: Train teams across 4+ countries on digital data systems and analytics
